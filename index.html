  The intersection of <a href="#" title="Tooltip Digital money">Digital money</a> and traditional finance is at 400 South LaSalle Street in Chicago this weekend. That’s where trading in bitcoin futures opens <a href="#" title="Sunday">Sunday</a> evening, as the first major U.S. exchange offers a product pegged to the wildly fluctuating cryptocurrency.

The currency has risen more than 1,500 percent this year, and about 85 percent just in the past two weeks, driven largely by demand from individual investors. But even as bitcoin -- launched in 2009 as an alternative to banks -- divides Wall Street executives and central bankers worldwide, those kinds of gains are a powerful magnet.

  The futures offered by Cboe <a href="#" title="Global Markets Inc.">Global Markets Inc.</a>, and similar contracts that start trading in a week at at another Chicago-based exchange, CME Group Inc., may open the door to greater inflows of institutional money, while also making it easier to bet on bitcoin’s decline. Either way, it’s likely trading will start slowly, said Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Investment Partners, which is raising a crypto hedge fund targeted at $500 million.

“If people have expectations that it’s going to have huge liquidity on day one, they’re just wrong,” Novogratz said Thursday in Toronto. “It’s going to take a while to build liquidity. People need to go through at least one cycle to figure out how it settles.”
